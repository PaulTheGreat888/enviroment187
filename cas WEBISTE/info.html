  <h1 class="text-center">Why is Climate Change happening?</h1>
  <div class="row align-items-center mt-5">
    <div class="col-lg-6">
      <p>What are the reasons for climate change? Climate change became a huge problem over the last few years, as the temperatures keep climbing. There are several reasons for this phenomenon. One of the biggest issues is the burning of fossil fuels. While fossil fuels are burnt a lot of carbon is released in our atmosphere, where the carbon traps heat, which ends up in the earth warming up. Another big problem we face is the Deforestation that happens all around the world. Plants need carbon dioxide in the process of photosynthesis, to produce their energy. This is why trees are so important for us humans. By cutting those trees down, we stop their process of breaking down carbon dioxide. Agriculture and Livestock farming also plays a big role in climate change. They are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, primarily through the use of fertilizers and livestock waste. Deforestation and Agriculture often go hand in hand as forests get cut down in order to get space for huge farms. The problem with agriculture and livestock farming is that they release large amounts of greenhouse gases, including methane and nitrous oxide, which are even wors than carbon dioxide in terms of trapping heat in the atmosphere. Another big problem is the transportation of goods as cars, trucks, ships and planes release great amounts of carbon dioxide. This is why people should try to buy local products. This reduces the carbon emission and also helps the local farmers. The rapid industrialization of the world since the 20th century is another point. Big machinery also produced a lot of carbon dioxide and many dangerous waste products are often not disposed properly. Obviously, there are many more causes for carbon emission but those are the biggest points.  What are the outcomes of climate change? Climate change plays a big role on our environment and on other ecosystems. The most famous example for this is polar bears. Through the rise of temperature, the ice starts to melt, which drastically shrinks their habitat. This makes it very hard for them to hunt seals. This often ends up in starvations as the polar bears do not get enough food. There are many other animals who are close to becoming extinct as the temperature conditions in their habitat change. Another problem is that many plants also get destroyed due to lacks of rain water or simply a too aggressive temperature change. </p>
