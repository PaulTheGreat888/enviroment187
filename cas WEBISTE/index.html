                    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
                    <p>We are two students from the Montessori international high school am Herzogberg. Climate Change was always a big topic for us as well as keeping the environment clean. We want to make a change as we do not have a second planet earth. Finding out about all the effects Climate change brings with it really shocked us. Also, it really hurt us to see in which bad conditions the Liesing River is. This is why we decided to clean it. It was a lot of hard work collecting empty cans and plastic bottles. Unfortunately, the river was dirty again only a few weeks later. This is why we want people to be aware of their actions, as the water quality gets wors. When we both were children the Liesing river was in a way better quality and even freshwater crabs lived in it. Over the years a lot of trash ended up in the river and it really hurts to see this. We still sometimes go there to collect trash but it is not possible to keep up with all of the waste that ends up in this river, which was once a beautiful place. People of Vienna really need to change their mindset, getting rid of waste is very easy but most people do not care for their environment. Liesing should be a nice place to live in even for our future generations. Do people really want their children to grow up in such a messy place? At least we do not want that. If you share the same opinion then please make a difference. It is time to act now. Invite friends or family and help to keep the river clean, so that it is a cosy place to stay at again. If you do not have enough time, at least do not litter, this helps the people who care for this place. Also, if you share the same opinion and want to help, you could donate some money on our website, this would help a lot for us to keep this website online and to buy cleaning material.    </p>
